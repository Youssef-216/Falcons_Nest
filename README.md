Falcons nest is a website designed for NYUAD students. Its main goal is to present all the available resources on campus to the students in a fun, interactive and easy way. Falcon’s nest offers a playful and fun alternative to the stiff and classical designs of the university websites. Moreover, it allows the students to have quick and easy access to the resources on campus without having to go through a maze of hyperlinks.
Falcon’s nest user-friendly interface and colorful environment seeks to appeal to the gen-z generation and university students. From the pastel color pallet to the interactive widgets and the flying mascot that hovers along the page while the user scrolls through the page.

Goal & mission:
University students often tend to isolate themselves in their buble, focusing on academics and job search which has a huge impact on their physical and mental health. My team's video sought to represent an NYUAD student in their run around campus, the song Eye Of the Tiger playing in the background. We wanted our video to portray the beauty of campus but also the importance of physical activity and how getting out of the room for a simple thing like a run around campus can be an uplifting and fun experience.
The website seeks to complement the video’s energy but also allow student to have quick and easy access to health resources, art events, sig activities and the spots available around campus, in an attempt to encourage students to get out of their bubbles and engage with others.

Process:
The process of making this website was very fun and fruitful as I have had various challenges setting the elements in place, fixing the various features and implementing the video in the beginning. Using flex box was also a challenge, as I was setting up the website, and having the flipping effect work correctly and seemlesly. Using javascript was very fun as it seemed straightforward and effective.

Reflection/Evaluation:
I am happy about the end result of the website and I believe that it achieves its goals. I believe that the website would be more effective if it also included other helpful resources such as mental health advice, maybe a healthy recipe for healthy dishes, and fun outdoors activities in Abu dhabi. As I improve my web design skill I would love to make the site more interactive and smoother for a better user experience.
